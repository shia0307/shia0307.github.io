These posed pictures don't always capture those true moments of delight. The true candid moments are lost to the delete button, or not captured at all.</p><p class="stream-problem">To capture these moments, we put ourselves behind a screen and get taken out of living the moments we intend to capture. We believe there is a better way to capture these moments in a more ambient and user-centered way.</p><p class="stream-problem">We think there is a lack of connection in personal relationships. This impacts both the individual relationships, and the community as a whole.</p>

                    <p class="bigger-p">We began the 10 week project by exploring the concept of happiness and whether there were health benefits correlated with happiness. We conducted extensive secondary research and informal interviews, which resulted in a focus on connection and reflection to increase happiness.</p>
                    <p class="bigger-p">With this focus in mind, we developed the three goals as mentioned before. These goals guided us through our ideation process. We eventually focused on using sensors to automatically capture video during happy moments, allowing people to remain engaged in their environment, rather than their devices.</p>
