                    <p class="bigger-p">Stream inspires people to live vibrant and fulfilling lives by using peaks in happiness or Emotional Arousal as triggers for the capturing and documentation of memories. Two small transferable parts:  a sensor that implements GSR, EDR, GPS and audio to detect these moments and a line of sight camera to capture them, create streams of content that can be viewed on any personal computing device. </p><p class="bigger-p">By offering reflection and nostalgia of our happiest moments during down time, stream not only allows us to fully engage with these experiences in the moment, it prompts us to go forth into the world and create more memories, and likewise more content.</p><br><br><p class="bigger-p">This project was created in response to the theme "Billions of Sensors" for the 2014 Microsoft Design Expo:</p>

             <p class="stream-problem">Today. our camera roll and social network are filled with hand selected "perfect" pictures. These posed pictures don't always capture those true moments of delight. The true candid moments are lost to the delete button, or not captured at all.</p><p class="stream-problem">To capture these moments, we put ourselves behind a screen and get taken out of living the moments we intend to capture. We believe there is a better way to capture these moments in a more ambient and user-centered way.</p><p class="stream-problem">We think there is a lack of connection in personal relationships. This impacts both the individual relationships, and the community as a whole.</p>
