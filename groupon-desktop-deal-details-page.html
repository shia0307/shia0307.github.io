        <p class="center paragraph">Desktop deal page is where Groupon business started. Back in the days when Groupon only sell one deal a day, all a user has to see was the deal page. However, Groupon has changed so much that a simple deal details page design no longer meet the needs of our multi-business.
          <br>
          <br>We tried more than a dozen of optimizations on the page in the past year and a half, but we never got to make significant changes on deal details page on desktop, due to the unique setup of our organization and operational changes in the company.
          <br>
          <br>However, in Q2 2016, following the success of mobile web 2016, we decided to bring the thinking and learning to the desktop platform, finally my design saw the light of day.</p>

        <p class="center paragraph tp-16">To better understand the browser behavior and the page reaction, I coded a <a href="http://shiyaliang.me/prototype/deal-page-prototype.html" target="_blank">responsive prototype</a> with HTML+CSS. The main purpose of the prototype was to communicate the movement of design elements on the page to product manager and developers, so that the team can provide feedback on a something other than a static mockup.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="center paragraph">One of the most challenging feature I've worked on during the process was redesigning the Fine Print section.
        <br>Fine Print is where users understand how to use the deal, and find out about any restrictions that are applied to the deal. For example "Limit 1 per person", and "Not valid for happy hour".
        <br>
        <br>In the researches, we found that a lot of users had negative experience using Groupon because they did not pay attention to the restrictions in the Fine Print section. And majority of these users ended up not using the Groupon, and never came back to buy Groupon again.
        <br>
        <br>Business analyst shows that, negative experience due to not noticing fine print lead to increase of customer service contact, increase of refunds, and reduction in future transaction. We estimate a 5 million dollar lost per month with the Fine Print issue persist.
        <br>
        <br>We ended up A/B testing the design in the middle of the image above. And the team had to be really careful about what success metrics we evaluate against, because making restrictions about the deal more clear to users doesn't not necessary help conversion lift. We will also track customer service calls and refund for this design.</p>
