                    <p class="bigger-p">Consider about the imagery above, there was anxiety, fustration, confusion, stress. These are all emotions that people feel at the airport. And a primary reson for this is because people feel tethered to the gate.</p>
                    <p class="bigger-p">In our initial primary research, we found that passengers prioritize getting to the gate above other needs. They may not venture to find a much-needed aspirin. They may not feel comfortable hanging out at the kids play area at the other end of the terminal. We identified these behavior as tethering to the gate.</p><p class="bigger-p">Passengers are tethered to the gate for the following resons:</p>

                  <h3 class="second-title">A Physical Milestone</h3>
                  <p>Especially in unfamiliar airports, passengers want to go straight to the gate because they need to know where it is, to prevent the risk of geting lost and missing a flight.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h3 class="second-title">Source of Information</h3>
                    <p>At the gate, passengers can interpret presented information, such as whether your flight is delayed or on time. You can see whether the plane is at the gate, or hear when they start announcing the boarding process.</p>

              <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h3 class="second-title">Place of Service</h3>
                    <p>Passengers go to the gate to request seat upgrades or changes and to put in a standby request, and often need to be at the gate to seek advice from the gate agents.</p>

             <p class="bigger-p">Skylark is a system that delivers contextual, personalized information to passengers as they move through the airport. It integrates data from disparate sources that passengers need. It then pushes vital notifications to ensure passengers make their flights on time, enables direct communication with gate agents, and provides information that helps people decide what to do with their time in the airport.</p>

                <p>Skylark gathers data from different information sources. This includes flight updates from airline systems, gate activities, indoor maps, directories from airport systems, and individual location data using bluetooth beacons</p>
                <p>Skylark communicates with a smartphone application. There is future potential to deploy Skylark on other platforms, including wearables and in-environment displays. Each has unique properties which would complement the systemâ€™s ability to deliver contextual, personalized data in dynamic, often chaotic airport environments.</p>

             <p class="bigger-p">Our research shows that passengers are not the only ones impacted by the phenomenon of tethering to the gate. Airlines and airports, both key stakeholders in air travel, are aff ected as well.</p>

              <h2>Airlines</h2>
              <p>Airlines care about tethering at the gate because they want to improve the customer experience.</p><p>Airlines have a very narrow profit margin of 1.8% ( $5.94 per passenger) as a result of regulatory restrictions and fluctuating fuel costs, according to the International Air Transport Association. This means that competition is fierce among airlines, and one way airlines set themselves apart is through improved customer experience.</p><p>Tethering at the gate also means that more people are concentrated around their gates, leading to crowding. This impacts on-time departures, and leads to overwhelmed, overworked gate agents.</p>

              <h2>Airports</h2>
              <p>Airports care about tethering at the gate because they want to grow revenues that are not dependent on the airlines.</p><p>According to Airports Council International, 70% of airports are not focusing on non-aviation revenue as a way to cope with the volatility of the airlines business cycle. Two ways that airports grow revenues is by increasing airport capacity to process more passengers, and encouraging spending in shops and restaurants in the airport. According to an interview with a Port of Seattle representative, solving the problem of crowding at the gate is a huge value for airports because it increases capacity and eff iciency of the airport.</p>

We even re-created an airport environment here on campus, and had participants play a game in which they had to complete as many tasks as they could while making their flights on time. These activities revealed a lot about people's behaviors and needs related to the gate.</p>
