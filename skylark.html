                    <p class="bigger-p">Our initial primary research revealed an opportunity to focus on the phase of the passenger journey between the TSA security checkpoint and the gate. We found that passengers prioritize getting to the gate above other needs. They may not venture to find a much-needed aspirin. They may not feel comfortable hanging out at the kids play area at the other end of the terminal. Tethering to the gate leads to unpleasant experiences and feelings. Passengers are tethered to the gate for the following resons:</p>

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <h3 class="second-title">A Physical Milestone</h3>
                  <p>Especially in unfamiliar airports, passengers want to go straight to the gate because they need to know where it is, to prevent the risk of geting lost and missing a flight.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h3 class="second-title">Source of Information</h3>
                    <p>At the gate, passengers can interpret presented information, such as whether your flight is delayed or on time. You can see whether the plane is at the gate, or hear when they start announcing the boarding process.</p>

                    <h3 class="second-title">Place of Service</h3>
                    <p>Passengers go to the gate to request seat upgrades or changes and to put in a standby request, and often need to be at the gate to seek advice from the gate agents.</p>

             <p class="bigger-p">Today. our camera roll and social network are filled with hand selected "perfect" pictures. These posed pictures don't always capture those true moments of delight. The true candid moments are lost to the delete button, or not captured at all.</p><p class="">To capture these moments, we put ourselves behind a screen and get taken out of living the moments we intend to capture. We believe there is a better way to capture these moments in a more ambient and user-centered way.</p><p class="">We think there is a lack of connection in personal relationships. This impacts both the individual relationships, and the community as a whole.</p>

                    <p class="bigger-p">We began the 10 week project by exploring the concept of happiness and whether there were health benefits correlated with happiness. We conducted extensive secondary research and informal interviews, which resulted in a focus on connection and reflection to increase happiness.</p>
                    <p class="bigger-p">With this focus in mind, we developed the three goals as mentioned before. These goals guided us through our ideation process. We eventually focused on using sensors to automatically capture video during happy moments, allowing people to remain engaged in their environment, rather than their devices.</p>
