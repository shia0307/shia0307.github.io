                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">With the increase popularity of car sharing services like Uber and Lyft, people are more used to the concept of car sharing. However their model still requires a lot of pre-planning and the car is mostly empty while it's not working. We would like to take this concept a step further. We want to connect drivers and passengers that are going to the same direction, and share the ride along the way. We want to explore the idea of car sharing in the furture:</p> 
                    <p id="what-if">"What if you can hop on to any car drives by?"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-6">
                  <h3 class="second-title">Problem</h3>
                  <p>According to US Department of Transportation, 75% of the US commuter drive alone, A big amout of gas and space is wasted. And we all know how it feels like to stuck in traffic in rush hours.</p>

                    <p class="bigger-p"><i>"How can we make short-distance carpooling easier and more efficient?"</i></p>

                <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
                    <h3 class="second-title">Our Solution</h3>
                    <p>The Hitch Hiker application quickly matches drivers who are driving on their daily routine, and passengers who need to go to the same direction. The application is intended to be used spontaneously for both passenger and driver. In other words, there is no need for pre planning for both passenger and driver.</p>

As you can see in the timeline, as a team, we decided to focus on the hands-on activities and spend just enough time to find a interesting problem area that we want to tackle with.</p>
